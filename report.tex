\begin{abstract}
The ease of access to a car has to be traded of against the security of the
access to the vehicle.
Systems for Passive key-less Entry (PKE) are available in a broad range of cars,
and allow the owner to open the vehicle only by having the key in his pocket.
As this enhances the ease of use, this feature has impacts on the security of
the car which will be discussed in this article. The implications range from 
basic access up to taking fully fledged control of the cars most important
systems.
