%Section on Distance bounding protocols

\subsection{Introduction}

	These protocols were designed to ensure an upper bound for a distance between to entities.
	They were introduced by \citeauthor{distanceBoundingProtocols}.
	Distance bounding protocols were evaluated by \citeauthor{secPos}.
	They discribe a protocol implements this upper bounding.
