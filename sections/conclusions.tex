%Conclusion section for the report on PKE systems
Passive keyless entry systems are vulnerable to many kinds of attacks,
which can in some cases be carried out very easily.
The security mechanisms that are in place are not hardened enough to withstand
a clever and accordingly equipped attacker.
He can make use of the security flaws with a low amount of money and risk of getting caught.
The fact that PKE systems are especially a feature of expensive and luxury class cars is very delicate.
The implications these attacks can have on the overall car security are enormous.
Especially in combination with the results that were achieved by \cite{expModernAuto}.
The typical driver might not be aware of the fact how bad the security standards
in the cars electronics are implemented.

This should enhance the pressure on manufacturers to incorporate more secure methods
that can atleast withstand simple relay attacks.
Methods that ensure the security are available for a reasonable amount of time.
Distance bounding protocols do not completely solve the problem of proper localization in
wireless networks,
but they are surely capable of ensuring secure PKE systems.
And even more simple approaches using signals with different strength,
enhance security to a reasonable level,
without sacrificing the ease of use.
