%Introduction par in the article on PKE
The securityproblem in PKE bases on the problem of proper localization in
wireless networks.
Although it seems intuitive that the postion of devices can be calculated by
triangulation, there are some attacks that allow the alteration of the postion.

In wireless security these attacks are know as ``Wormhole-Attack''.
They use the same underlying mechanisms, as the attacks on PKE Systems.
