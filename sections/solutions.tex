\subsection{Shortterm}
% shutdown
	As described in Section \ref{sec:relayAttacks}, relay attacks are serious issue.
	Especially because of its implications on overall vehicle security as described in Section \ref{sec:attackImplications}.
	Usually it is possible to disable the PKE system in the cars.
	Access to the vehicle can be gained by a backup key system.
	The CID usually encorporates a backup key so that disabling the PKE feature is possible.
	This of course lowers the ease of access.

\subsection{Midterm}
%improvement described in "Some attacks against vechicles pkes .. ."
	In order to make attacks more difficult the manufactures could hard their systems.
	\citeauthor{someAttacksPKES} elaborate som methods to harden PKE systems.
	They describe a Systems using communication in RF.
	This kind of communication would introduce a feedback loop into the attackers relay systems.
	The feedback loop could be easily detected by the PKE system so that access is prohibited.
	Although the the authors also present an attack with \textsl{three thieves} that could still
	carry out the attack.

\subsection{Longterm}
