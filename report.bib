abstract={ As mobile ad hoc network applications are deployed, security emerges as a central requirement. In this paper, we introduce the wormhole attack, a severe attack in ad hoc networks that is particularly challenging to defend against. The wormhole attack is possible even if the attacker has not compromised any hosts, and even if all communication provides authenticity and confidentiality. In the wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them (possibly selectively) to another location, and retransmits them there into the network. The wormhole attack can form a serious threat in wireless networks, especially against many ad hoc network routing protocols and location-based wireless security systems. For example, most existing ad hoc network routing protocols, without some mechanism to defend against the wormhole attack, would be unable to find routes longer than one or two hops, severely disrupting communication. We present a general mechanism, called packet leashes, for detecting and, thus defending against wormhole attacks, and we present a specific protocol, called TIK, that implements leashes. We also discuss topology-based wormhole detection, and show that it is impossible for these approaches to detect some wormhole topologies.},

   abstract = {Distance-bounding protocols aim to prevent an adversary from pretending that two parties are physically closer than they really are. We show that proposed distance-bounding protocols of Hu, Perrig and Johnson (2003), Sastry, Shankar and Wagner (2003), and Čapkun and Hubaux (2005, 2006) are vulnerable to a guessing attack where the malicious prover preemptively transmits guessed values for a number of response bits. We also show that communication channels not optimized for minimal latency imperil the security of distance-bounding protocols. The attacker can exploit this to appear closer himself or to perform a relaying attack against other nodes. We describe attack strategies to achieve this, including optimizing the communication protocol stack, taking early decisions as to the value of received bits and modifying the waveform of transmitted bits. We consider applying distance-bounding protocols to constrained devices and evaluate existing proposals for distance bounding in ad hoc networks.},

abstract={Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks. While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency and safety, it has also introduced a range of new potential risks. In this paper we experimentally evaluate these issues on a modern automobile and demonstrate the fragility of the underlying system structure. We demonstrate that an attacker who is able to infiltrate virtually any Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can leverage this ability to completely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems. Over a range of experiments, both in the lab and in road tests, we demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver inputdash including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on. We find that it is possible to bypass rudimentary network security protections within the car, such as maliciously bridging between our car's two internal subnets. We also present composite attacks that leverage individual weaknesses, including an attack that embeds malicious code in a car's telematics unit and that will completely erase any evidence of its presence after a crash. Looking forward, we discuss the complex challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities while considering the existing automotive ecosystem.},

abstract={ Remote control of vehicle functions using a handheld electronic device became a popular feature for vehicles. Such functions include, but are not limited to, locking, unlocking, remote start, window closures, and activation of an alarm. As consumers enjoy the remote access and become more comfortable with the remote functions, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have started looking for new features to simplify and reduce the user interface for vehicle access. These new features will provide users with an additional level of comfort without requiring them to touch or press any button on any remote devices to gain access to the vehicle. While this extra level of comfort is a desirable feature, it introduces several security threats against the vehicle's keyless-entry system. This paper describes a number of attacks against the security of keyless-entry systems of vehicles and also presents analyzes of several attacks and compares the vulnerability of the system under different attacks. At the end, some suggestions for improved design are proposed.},

   abstract = {It is often the case in applications of cryptographic protocols that one party would like to determine a practical upper-bound on the physical distance to the other party. For instance, when a person conducts a cryptographic identification protocol at an entrance to a building, the access control computer in the building would like to be ensured that the person giving the responses is no more than a few meters away. The “distance bounding” technique we introduce solves this problem by timing the delay between sending out a challenge bit and receiving back the corresponding response bit. It can be integrated into common identification protocols. The technique can also be applied in the three-party setting of “wallets with observers” in such a way that the intermediary party can prevent the other two from exchanging information, or even developing common coinflips.},
